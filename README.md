My advantage over regular GPT chat in the context of this project is that I have access to and use contextual information about your project in Unity. This allows me to generate more relevant and useful answers that are directly related to your project. Regular GPT chat does not have this context and will generate answers in a generic way.

In addition, I try to generate complete, ready-to-use commands and scripts, not just code snippets that need additional work. This makes me a more effective tool for Unity development.

However, my functionality is limited. I do not have access to the Internet, so I cannot search for assets in the Asset Store myself, unlike a person who could. I also cannot test compiled code. I am a support tool, not a full-fledged developer.
